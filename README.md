# My-SearchMachine
This library was developed during the discipline of "Algorithms and Data Structures" at UFMG.  It aims to implement some of the main concepts of search and hashing algorithms and to simulate a search engine that, given a database or articles is able to tell if a list of terms received are present in those articles and in what quantity .

## Install

To test this library, just make a clone of this repo using the command below:

> git clone https://github.com/NanderSantos/My-SearchMachine.git

> cd search-machine

Then, just run the following command to allow the build.sh file to run:

> chmod +x build.sh

Finally run this command and everything will be done:

> ./build.sh

Or use this magical one-liner command to make it easiest:

> git clone https://github.com/NanderSantos/My-SearchMachine.git && cd My-SearchMachine && chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh

## Run

To run the program just use the following command line below:

> ./search consulta.txt  stopword_file.txt

To see the results of other searches, just change the input words in the consulta.txt file
